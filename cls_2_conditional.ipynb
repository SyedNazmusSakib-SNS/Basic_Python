    "1. We started with simple `if` statements\n",
    "2. We progressed to `if-else` and `if-elif-else` chains\n",
    "3. We explored comparison and logical operators\n",
    "4. We learned about nested conditionals and conditional expressions\n",
    "5. We reviewed common pitfalls and best practices\n",
    "6. We solved progressively more challenging problems\n",
    "7. We explored advanced techniques and real-world applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditionals are the foundation of decision-making in programming. Mastering them is essential to creating dynamic, responsive programs that can adapt to different situations. Keep practicing with the problems provided, and try to create your own conditionals to solve new challenges!"
